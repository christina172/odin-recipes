    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lemon self-saucing pudding is a delight! Light, fluffy sponge with a zesty lemon sauce beneath.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <li>3 lemons</li>
        <li>100 g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>200 g sugar</li>
        <li>4 medium eggs</li>
        <li>75 g flour</li>
        <li>500 ml milk</li></ul>
    <ol><h2>Steps:</h2>  
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C. Butter a 2 litre shallow ovenproof dish.</li>
        <li>Grate the zest from two of the lemons, then squeeze the juice of all three.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter with the 100 g of sugar and lemon zest. Beat in the egg yolks one by one. Don't worry if the mixture curdles. Next beat in the flour a spoonful at a time, alternating with slurps of milk and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Once that is all in, whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl, then gradually add 100 g of sugar and continue whisking until they form stiff peaks, and fold lightly into the lemon batter.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the baking dish, then stand the dish in a roasting tin. Pour enough boiling water around the dish to come about halfway up the sides.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 40â€“45 minutes until the pudding is golden brown. Serve hot or warm, with or without cream.</li>
    </ol>
