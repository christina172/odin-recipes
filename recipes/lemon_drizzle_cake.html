    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This wonderfully simple lemon drizzle cake recipe is super-quick to prepare. This recipe makes a lemon drizzle loaf, but if you want to make a lemon cake in a different shape.</p>

    <li>225 butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</li>
    <li>225 g caster sugar</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>225 g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 lemon, zest and juice</li>
    <li>85 g icing sugar</li></ul>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease a 900g loaf tin with a little butter and line with baking paper.</li>
    <li>Whisk butter with caster sugar. Add the eggs one at a time. Add the flour and lemon zest and whisk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the lined baking tin, flatten the top with the back of a spoon and bake for 50â€“55 minutes.</li>
